Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

i. Attribute table = 	10000 records
ii. Business table =	10000 records
iii. Category table =	10000 records
iv. Checkin table =		10000 records
v. elite_years table =10000 records
vi. friend table =		10000 records
vii. hours table =		10000 records
viii. photo table =		10000 records
ix. review table =		10000 records
x. tip table =				10000 records
xi. user table =			10000 records



2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =			10000 distinct records for primary key ->'id'
ii. Hours =				1562 	distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
iii. Category =		2643 	distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
iv. Attribute =		1115 	distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
v. Review =				10000 distinct records for primary key ->'id', 9581 distinct records for foreign key ->'user_id' & 9581 distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
vi. Checkin =			493 	distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
vii. Photo =			10000 distinct records for primary key ->'id' & 6493 distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id'
viii. Tip =				3979 	distinct records for foreign key ->'business_id' &  537 distinct records for foreign key ->'user_id'
ix. User =				10000 distinct records for primary key ->'id'
x. Friend =				11 		distinct records for foreign key ->'user_id'
xi. Elite_years = 2780 	distinct records for foreign key ->'user_id'

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I will select  Las Vegas as the city because it contain most number of reviews(82854) andd most business(1561) are present in Las Vegas & business category will be Shopping.

select city, sum(review_count) as r_count from business group by city order by r_count desc;

+-----------------+---------+
| city            | r_count |
+-----------------+---------+
| Las Vegas       |   82854 |
| Phoenix         |   34503 |
| Toronto         |   24113 |
| Scottsdale      |   20614 |

+-----------------+------------+
| city            | city_count |
+-----------------+------------+
| Las Vegas       |       1561 |
| Phoenix         |       1001 |
| Toronto         |        985 |
| Scottsdale      |        497 |

+------------------------------+-----------------+
| category                     | count(category) |
+------------------------------+-----------------+
| Health & Medical             |               4 |
| Restaurants                  |               4 |
| Shopping                     |               4 |
| American (New)               |               2 |

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Yes, they have different distribution of hours i.e.
Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center  : 8:00-16:30  i.e. 8hrs 30 min  All days
Desert Medical Equipment 				: 8:00-17:00  i.e. 9 hrs        All days except weekends
Walgreens												: 8:00-22:00  i.e. 14 hrs       All days

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, they have different number of reviews i.e.
Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center  : 32
Desert Medical Equipment 				: 4
Walgreens	  										: 6


iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No its difficult to infer any info from the location data as all of them have different postal code , neighborhood info is also null for some business and also latitude , longitude info is not precise.

SQL code used for analysis:
select
    case
    when stars >=4 then '4-5 stars'
    when stars<=3 and stars>=2 then '2-3 stars'
    end as rating,
    name,hours,review_count,latitude, longitude, neighborhood,  postal_code

from business as b inner join category as c on b.id=c.business_id
inner join  hours as h on  b.id=h.business_id
where city='Las Vegas'  and category='Shopping' and (stars >=4 or (stars<=3 and stars>=2 ))
order by rating desc


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.

i. Difference 1:
The avg star/rating of open Business is more:

				avg(stars) for Close: 3.52039473684
				avg(stars) for Open : 3.67900943396


ii. Difference 2:
 Review count is more for open business i.e. business that are open are getting more reviews.

			 avg(review_count) for Close: 23.1980263158
			 avg(review_count) for Open : 31.7570754717

SQL code used for analysis:
select
    is_open,count(stars) as Occurence,sum(stars),avg(stars),sum(review_count),avg(review_count)
from business
group by is_open

+---------+-----------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| is_open | Occurence | sum(stars) |    avg(stars) | sum(review_count) | avg(review_count) |
+---------+-----------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|       0 |      1520 |     5351.0 | 3.52039473684 |             35261 |     23.1980263158 |
|       1 |      8480 |    31198.0 | 3.67900943396 |            269300 |     31.7570754717 |
+---------+-----------+------------+---------------+-------------------+-------------------+


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:

i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I will try to predict the stars/rating of a review, it can be undestood as sentiment analysis for review. Higher the rating more positive review and vice versa.


ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The most important part for predicting sentiment analysis will be the text/review, which we will get from the review table,And we have added one more column which check wether text/review contain "love" or "HATE" word, if it contain love then we have added "love" , & if contain "hate", then we have added hate in the extra column.


iii. Output of your finished dataset:

|           1 | Came on Valentine's Day night having pre-bought tickets. We ended up waiting in line for over ten minutes (missing the beginning of our movie) because all of their automated ticketing machines were broken and they weren't properly staffed at the ticket counters. Just to pick up tickets that we had already bought!!! Seriously annoying from a theater that usually is so enjoyable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |      1 |     1 |    1 | Galaxy Cannery Theatre                  |            4.0 |          251 |       1 |      None |
|           5 | Wow, we've been missing out, should've tried this a lot sooner. Our NYE at home featured pizza and tiki drinks. My bf called for take-out (I figured it would be at least an hour wait), and they told him 20 minutes, nice! It wasn't hard to find, though definitely not in a well-traveled area. Actually, had it been across Rio Salado in the Tempe Marketplace, we would not have tried it, because I HATE HATE HATE Tempe Marketplace, but that's another story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |      0 |     0 |    0 | Spinato's Pizza                         |            4.5 |          507 |       1 |      hate |

|             | My first visit I specifically requested Dr. Woodson herself after reading a lot of neutral to negative reviews for her PA and NP. After filling out a ton of paperwork (most of which was not very welcoming- I think I signed about three different forms promising I would definitely pay my bill or be sent to a debt collector. I get they want their money, but what a way to greet your new patients!) I went into the exam room and lo and behold PA John Notabartolo walks into the room. Since I was already there I just went with it. He examined my skin (I went in for some mild adult acne) for less than ten seconds, told me basic skin care advice that I've known about for years, and then wrote me some prescriptions. The whole visit with him lasted about three minutes. No real suggestions or overview of my current skin care regime, no explanation of the possible cause of my condition or what level of severity it was. Basically the only thing I couldn't have found on my own online was the prescriptions. |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |

|             | As another reviewer noted, they tend to prescribe the newest brand name drugs and of course both of mine were brand name and expensive! Thankfully my insurance covered mine with a reasonable co-pay, but definitely double check with your insurance before getting them filled. The prescriptions did help my skin, which was awesome. I went back for a follow up as they'd requested to see me in a few weeks and after waiting for over forty minutes past my appointment time was taken back with very little apology for the wait. Again another three minute visit with the PA with another very hurried skin examination and I left wondering why I'd wasted two hours of my time and another doctor's bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |

|             | Only one lady at the front desk was very friendly; everyone one else in the office seemed less than thrilled to be there. They did call with appointment reminders, which was nice, however the first time they left a voicemail with the time but not the date, and the second time they left a voicemail with one time and then called back and left another voicemail with a different time. Their bills also have the quickest due date I have ever seen. They give you 10 days from when they print the bill until the due date- but they seem to take 1-2 days to mail the bill (so 8 days left), plus 1-2 days in the mail (6 days left), so by the time you get it you have about 4-5 days to get it in the mail to make sure it arrives on time. You better hope you're not on vacation when they send the bill!                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |

|             | The last in the chain of events to make me move on to a new doctor was when I called to reschedule my third appointment and was put on hold for 7 minutes and then was greeted by a bored sounding woman who barely apologized for the wait. Instead of rescheduling I just asked her to cancel. I hung up and smiled as I realized I'd successfully broken up with my doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |

|             | Nothing this office did was horrible, but nothing they did was great either. The little moments of what I consider mediocre medical care and blase customer service just added up for me to the point where I didn't want to deal with it anymore. There's plenty of dermatology offices in this city and given the low reviews dating back for years I feel like this office isn't that interested in improving their business- so I'll just take mine elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |

|           5 | The one thing that most pleasantly surprised me regarding my entire experience of finding the perfect engagement ring for my (now) fiancée was how comfortable the entire process was. All of the credit has to go Jonathan and the great business he has going with Kimberfire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |      0 |     0 |    0 | Kimberfire                              |            5.0 |           27 |       1 |      Love |
|             | Like a lot of guys, I am utterly clueless about jewelry and what constitutes a wearable as 'beautiful' (finding good places to eat is more up my alley!). Straight away however, Jonathan's warm personality, expert knowledge, and professional demeanor had me at ease. I could feel right a way that I was in good hands...the guy just oozes integrity!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |
|             | The ring came out more beautiful than I could ever have imagined, and of course she said yes! I couldn't recommend buying your engagement ring at Kimberfire highly enough. My only advice would be that if you need to wait 8 or so weeks for a consultation, don't be intimidated - lock it in straight away! The wait is totally worth it to find something she'll be in love with wearing for the rest of her life!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |        |       |      |                                         |                |              |         |           |
|           4 | I love coming here! I came in today after being gone for months and both Julie and Jessica greeted me and remembered exactly how I like my nails. I always do the herbal healthy gel because I'm allergic to led/uv gel lights and liquid acrylic monomer. I've only had one negative experience here which I'll include a photo of, but they quickly and pleasantly fixed it within just a few days of my original appointment. This salon is amazing and smells great, no smell of nail glue or chemicals because they don't use any chemicals. The prices are higher but for someone who is allergic to all traditional nail products, the added cost is worth it for me. Especially the friendly experience!! A full set with the herbal gel (acrylic dip powder sans liquid monomer) is $45 so not too terrible. Keep in mind in asking for a shape other than square or round there is a $7 charge for shaping [so coffin, stiletto, flare will cost you a bit more].                                                                   |      0 |     0 |    0 | Herbal Nails & Spa -  - Happy Valley    |            3.5 |           49 |       1 |      Love |
